# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining: Homework 1
This repository aims at reporting my solutions to the challenges proposed by [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), as part of the coursework for Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining. The solutions are implemented in Python and aim to demonstrate proficiency in various aspects of Python programming and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Submission Details
---------------------
[Submission_HackerRank.pdf](./Submissions _HackerRank.pdf) includes the list of the submitted scripts, along with the scores achieved for each challenge. This PDF serves as a summary of successful solutions and their performance on the platform.

## Script Description
-----------
[Script.py](./scripts.py) contains the compleated python challenges on the [HACKERRANK](https://www.hackerrank.com/) online service.

It is divided into two main sections: Problem 1 and Problem 2.

## Problem 1

This first section is focused on skills building in Python.

### Challenges Overview

The challenges are grouped into the following categories:

 1. Introduction (7 exercises)
 2. Data types (6 exercises)
 3. Strings (14 exercises)
 4. Sets (13 exercises)
 5. Collections (8 exercises)
 6. Date and Time (2 exercises)
 7. Exceptions (1 exercise)
 8. Built-ins (3 exercise)
 9. Python Functionals (1 exercise)
 10. Regex and Parsing challenges (17 exercises)
 11. XML (2 exercises)
 12. Closures and Decorations (2 exercises)
 13. Numpy (15 exercises)

Each category contains multiple coding problems designed to enhance specific Python skills.


### Example Structure


Each section in script.py follows a consistent format for clarity and ease of understanding:

\# Name_Challenge_1 \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

\# Name_exercise_1

Problem 2 
---------------------
In this section, Python is used to implement algorithms that tackle various problem-solving tasks.

The implemented algorithms include:

* Birthday Cake Candles: Find the tallest candles that can be blown out.
* Number Line Jumps: Determine if two kangaroos meet after a series of jumps.
* Viral Advertising: Simulate the viral growth of an advertisement.
* Recursive Digit Sum: Compute digit sums using recursion.
* Insertion Sort - Part 1: Basic implementation of insertion sort.
* Insertion Sort - Part 2: Expanded version of the insertion sort algorithm.
